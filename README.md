Raspberry Pi to Agilent 33250A Setup Guide
This guide explains how to set up communication between a Raspberry Pi and an Agilent 33250A function generator using a USB-to-RS232 adapter.
Hardware Requirements

Raspberry Pi (any model)
USB-to-RS232 adapter
Standard RS-232 cable (DB9 connectors)
Agilent 33250A Function Generator
Power supplies for both devices

All of the functionality is in the Agilent_Controller_RS232.
